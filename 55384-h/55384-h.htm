<p>We call attention to the Thirty-third Annual Report of the
Association, recently published. In addition to the general survey
which was read at the Annual Meeting at Chicago, and the minutes of
that grand gathering, we have given, as usual, a detailed report of our
work, and we suggest to pastors and others who may desire to inform
themselves in regard to particular aspects of it, that if they will
notice, they will find all this matter so classified in the Report that
they can easily select just what they want. Thus, after the list of
institutions and teachers, they may find the following headings: Delay
in Opening Schools, Quality of the Work, Closing Exercises, Industrial
Departments, Growing Favor, Buildings, Rented Property, Libraries,
Student Aid, Religious Character of Schools, Colored Teachers,
Theological Departments. The Church Work and other main departments
are analyzed in the same way. We have done this, hoping to make the
Report a helpful document and one easily used by the friends of the
Association. Dr. Storrs’ sermon is also printed with it.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Miss Parmelee’s paper, read before the Woman’s Meeting at the
Anniversary in Chicago, excited so much interest at the time and since,
and gave so vivid, so faithful and so sympathetic a view of the perils
of the girls of the South, that we have, besides giving a portion of
it in a former <span class="smcap">Missionary</span>, re-printed it in
full, and have sent it largely to the Christian women of our churches.
We beg them to read it, remembering that its statements are facts, and
that the evils of which it speaks are among the better class of the
colored women of the South, and hardly suggest the depths below, in
which the mass are at home, and into which education and enlightenment
only make the fall more fatal. May God’s spirit move the hearts of our
Christian women to save their sisters.

<p>One of our colored ministers, trained in an American Missionary
Association school, in stating some incidents of his life to a friend,
said that he was led, when about sixteen years old, to give up gambling
and licentiousness, simply out of regard for his teacher, fearing that
she would learn of his evil ways and despise him. That teacher little
thought then, and has never learned even, of the blessed influence
upon that young man, of her pure and consecrated life, which, through
the providence of God, led to the transformation of a gambler and
profligate, into an efficient and esteemed Christian minister, through
whom she is now preaching to hundreds and even thousands.

<p>The Superintendent, scouring through Georgia, came across Rev.
Mr. Thomas, a choice man, who has charge of two colored Presbyterian
churches at Union Point and Woodstock, under commission of the
Northern General Assembly, and who got all his schooling&mdash;three
years&mdash;at our Lewis High School in Macon, Ga. So the fruit of our
tree of knowledge, is falling over into other church lots, and we are
glad of it. Such fruitage is a great encouragement to the teachers of
our minor schools.

<p><i>A Bible Example of Reconstruction.</i>&mdash;It was after the return
from Babylon. Civil and the moral reformation went hand in hand. The
first Governor, Zerubabel, who was a grandson of a former king, had
the high priest, Joshua, to lead in the worship, and the prophets,
Haggai and Zechariah, to preach and to teach. The next Governor,
Ezra, instituted for the instruction of the people an extensive
system of Bible-readings. “So they read in the Book, in the law of
God, distinctly and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the
reading.”
</p>

<p>The next Governor, Nehemiah, was a reformer. He put down the
practices of taking heathen wives, of violating the Sabbath, and of
exacting illegal interest. No improvement has as yet been made upon
that style of civil reconstruction. Religion and education, the church
and the school, must go along with the re-ordering of the State. So we
find our work at the South in the line of a Divine pattern. The Bible
gives us its ideal of dealing with freedmen by taking into its sacred
canon the five books of Moses for the emancipated Israelites, the books
of Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai and Zechariah, for the restored captives.

<h3>ZEAL FOR STUDY.</h3>

<p class="p1">A good deal has been said, from time to time, of the
abatement among the colored people of that eagerness to learn, which
marked the days immediately following their emancipation. Of course,
much of it is true; many found by trial that it was not so easy or
instantaneous a process to learn to read as they had supposed; the
pressure of self-support drew away the attention of others from their
aspirations after an education; unduly excited ambitions and crude
hopes were seen to be unfounded, and in the disappointment many were
discouraged. But all of it is not true. There are many instances yet
of the early eagerness to learn among the young, and even among the
old; we give an instance from a teacher’s letter: “One woman, 39 years
old, lives in the country, and walks six miles to school, and six miles
again after school to her home. Her seat has been vacant only on one
or two of the rainiest days since the school opened, September 1st. At
home, she has all her household affairs to look after, and finds time
to study at night even then; and if, on account of helping her husband
to pick cotton in the fall, she would go late to bed without ‘knowing
her lesson,’

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>

it ‘worried’ her so, she said, that she ‘could not get a wink of sleep,’
and her husband would waken to find her up and studying. She is gaining
slowly in rudimentary knowledge, and is very much pleased, or, as she
would say, ‘proud’ of her success. Several such ones, eager to learn, I
have under my care, and though they can learn but slowly, it is really
better than that they should never know anything, though I think we
would count it hardly worth while to take such pains so late in life;
yet, better to get upon the first round of the ladder than not to rise
at all.”

<h3>TROPICAL AFRICA.<br /> <span class="smaller">The Three Lake
Missions.</span></h3>

<p class="p1">Among the great movements of this stirring age, none
are, perhaps, more far-reaching than those for the exploration and
evangelization of Tropical Africa. The splendid achievements of
Livingstone and Stanley crown and complete the efforts of their heroic
predecessors. Africa’s three great central lakes and her two great
rivers&mdash;the mysteries of the ages&mdash;are now explored and
mapped.
</p>

<p>The missionary efforts that have followed these discoveries reveal
an enthusiasm, and a consecration of talent and life, worthy of the
vast field thus opened. In the promptness of the response, the money
and the lives devoted and the number of missions founded or projected,
the last five years give a history that probably has no parallel in
the records of Christian missions. The story of these adventures in
discovery and evangelization has the fascination of romance, and
is pathetic in the piety and the sufferings of both travellers and
missionaries.
</p>

<p>We select as illustrations the three Lake Missions of Tropical
Africa.
</p>

<p class="p1">1. The Victoria Nyanza Mission.</p>

<p>On the northern shores of this greatest of Africa’s central lakes is
the dominion of King Mtesa&mdash;a name now familiar to the civilized
world. He rules over two millions of people, has a navy of 300 war
canoes and an army of 150,000 warriors. In 1875, Stanley reached his
capital. The welcome was cordial, and for two months the traveller
taught the King the principles of Christianity with such happy results
that the Bible was studied, and in obedience to its teachings, an enemy
and rebel, conquered in battle and doomed to death in accordance with
African morals and invariable practice, was spared! Stanley appreciated
the true value of the King’s “conversion,” and saw the need of having
his own incipient teaching followed up by steady missionary labors.
His appeal for such labors was written in Africa and appeared in a
London paper Nov. 15, 1875. The prompt response should be noticed.
Three days after it appeared, came an anonymous offer of $25,000 for
the founding of the mission, and soon another equal sum was proffered.
The venerable and efficient Church Missionary Society undertook the
work. The consecrated money was soon followed by the consecrated men.
In 1876, the company of missionaries landed at Zanzibar, and travelling
the 800 miles of jungle in six months, and marking their first disaster
in the death of one of their party, reached Mtesa’s capital. They were
welcomed with enthusiasm, and when the name of Jesus was uttered, a
salute was fired. The work was begun immediately, but soon the second
great disaster came&mdash;two of the company, Lieutenant Smith and
Mr. O’Neill, were murdered at no great distance from the capital. But
instead of discouragement, these disasters called forth new enthusiasm.
Three young men were promptly sent out by the Church Missionary
Society. They took the Nile route, but a journey that should have taken
three or four months was protracted to nine

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>

by the floating islands in the Upper Nile and the ignorance of the
Arab captain. One of the missionaries received a sunstroke and was
obliged to return. At length they reached Uganda and were joyfully
received, but soon came the greatest calamity&mdash;a week after their
arrival two French Jesuit priests came also, and succeeded in so
disaffecting the mind of the King as to arrest the work, and lead to
the withdrawment of most of the missionaries. The summary at the latest
dates is: Sixteen missionaries in all have been sent, of whom six have
died and three have returned sick. Of the seven still in Africa, four
have been permitted to go on various duties and three remain at Uganda
without the facilities either to carry on their work or to withdraw.
</p>

<p class="p1">2. Tanganika Mission.</p>

<p>Ujiji, the location of the Tanganika Mission is endeared to the
friends of Livingstone. Here he made his temporary home, and here,
almost ready to die, he was discovered by Stanley, to be restored to
vigor and to toil still longer for Africa, till at last he was found
dead upon his knees. The plan for a mission here was formed by the
London Missionary Society, scarcely less venerable than the Church
Missionary Society.
</p>

<p>Mr. Arthington of Leeds, Eng., one of the generous and prompt
donors of $25,000 for the Nyassa Mission, gave a like sum for this.
Four ordained missionaries, one scientific man and one builder, left
London in March, 1877. Their journey from the coast of Africa was
protracted over thirteen months in consequence of the many obstacles
and vexatious delays. Added to these trials, death did its fearful
work. Under these discouraging circumstances, Dr. Mullen, the intrepid
and beloved Secretary of the Society, obtained the reluctant consent of
the Directors to lead in person an additional force, and to hasten the
progress of the supplies. But he had gone only 200 miles from the coast
when death closed his useful career. No event in the last five years
has cast such a gloom over mission circles in Great Britain as the sad
fate of this noble man.
</p>

<p class="p1">3. Nyassa Mission.</p>

<p>Again is the stimulus of Livingstone’s labors seen, and his name and
memory honored in the founding of another mission: the Livingstonia on
Lake Nyassa. It was a labor of love for the Free Church of Scotland,
aided by sister communions to undertake this mission. In the Spring of
1875, the expedition started, having been furnished with all needed
supplies, including a beautiful steel steamer and two boats for the use
of the mission on the Lake. After a tedious journey up the Zambesi and
Shiré and a toilsome land journey of 60 miles, around the Murchison
Falls, the Lake was at length reached.
</p>

<p>After a brief search, a site was selected that held out unusual
hopes of coveted advantages&mdash;there were no mosquitos and a
favoring lake breeze gave promise of health. But alas for the
unforeseen and insignificant difficulties that sometimes defeat
the greatest undertakings&mdash;the fatal tsetse fly compelled the
choice of a new location. But we cannot give space for the subsequent
details.
</p>

<p>The disasters and deaths in these missions have had a depressing
effect upon the hearts of Christians in Great Britain, and we fear that
the discouragements will to some extent be felt in this country. But we
must guard ourselves against hasty inferences and unwarranted fears. We
should remember:&mdash;
</p>

<p>1. That trials at the outset are often God’s means of arousing a
deeper faith. The history of missions, modern and Apostolic, is full
of examples. The Teloogoo Mission where such an unusual work of Divine
grace has recently been experienced and the converts have been numbered
by thousands, was for a long time the scene

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>

of unfruitful labors. Bishop Crowther’s Mission in West Africa, now so
strong and growing, had an early experience of toils and persecutions.
The Apostles themselves encountered imprisonments and death not only,
but their labors were sometimes followed by defections, perversions of
doctrine and scandals in life.
</p>

<p>2. We should take courage from the fact that the slave-trade, the
worst foe to missionary labors in Africa, is feeling the effects of the
earnest efforts of Great Britain for its overthrow. Sir Samuel Baker,
and after him Col. Gordon, the stout old Covenanter&mdash;the Havelock
of Africa&mdash;have crippled its power on the Upper Nile, while the
labors of Sir Bartle Frere, and subsequently of Dr. Kirk at Zanzibar,
have been equally effective along the coast, so that the Church
Missionary Intelligencer feels authorized to say that “the slave-trade
if not killed, is scotched.” The missions themselves, though hindered
in many respects, have had a salutary influence in shaming and
arresting this fiendish traffic.
</p>

<p>3. Finally, the church of God must bear in mind that the Saviour’s
last and great command, “Go ye into all the world and preach the
Gospel,” is accompanied by that all-comprehensive and all-sufficient
promise, “Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.”
God will redeem the whole world, and in the Saviour’s heart and plan,
Africa is not forgotten.

<h3>THE NEGRO IN AMERICA AND AFRICA.</h3>

<p class="p1">Dr. Edward W. Blyden, of Liberia, Africa, is the author of an interesting
article in the <cite>Methodist Quarterly Review</cite> for January, 1880, from which we gratefully
reprint elsewhere his tribute to our work. Anything which comes from the
pen of this distinguished gentleman&mdash;one of the most cultured men of the
race whose cause he pleads&mdash;is well worth reading and consideration. With much
that the Doctor says, we are in full and hearty agreement, but beg leave to make
one or two suggestions, growing out of what seem to be at least not unwarranted
deductions from his positions.
</p>

<p>No one can regret more than we do the prejudice which exists, in this country
especially, against the colored man. And there is no doubt that, as Dr. Blyden
observes, even among those who are not unmoved by the story of his wrongs, and
who are earnestly engaged in philanthropic efforts for his uplifting, this personal
prejudice and sense of superiority does exist. That it is not so to anything like
the same degree in England and on the Continent, is suggestive in the light it casts
upon the fact among us. On what is the difference of feeling founded? Certainly
not altogether in the natural race-prejudice. That is a fact not to be denied.
There is a prejudice which is universal between all people of distinct races of men.
It is felt by the original inhabitants of Africa against the Caucasian, as Dr. B.
shows, as well as by the white man in his own home against the black. But in
this land, the prejudice is intensified by the position and the character of those
who have made up the negro population.
</p>

<p>Dr. Blyden objects to our calling the Negro, Indian and Chinaman “the
despised races.” He even dislikes to have Africa called “the Dark Continent.”
Of course, our brother knows that the sympathies of this Association are, as
they have always been, with these people of his land, and that our toils and
labors have not been limited, nor of brief continuance, in their behalf. All this
he most fully and kindly acknowledges in his article. It is hardly necessary for
us to say, then, that we have used the term as describing what is, and as contrasted
with what ought to be. It is true, rightly or wrongly, that they have

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>

been looked down upon and are still despised. And we have used the word as
setting forth the fact, and as, therefore, the strongest plea to Christian sympathy
and help; for we have been sure that where we could enlist these, the term would
no longer have application. The good Samaritan did not despise the poor Jew
who had fallen among thieves, as he held him up on the ass which bore him to the
inn. He was too busy pitying and helping him. Perhaps this is enough to say.
We have used the term “the Despised Races” not as an epithet, but as a plea.
</p>

<p>A fair inference at least from the Doctor’s article is, that he sees no hope for his
people on this continent, and that their only way to success is to emigrate to the
land of their mothers, and to make its reclamation their ambition. But how does
that affect our work and the present generation? The American Colonization
Society, as seen by its last published report, sent out to Africa during the year 1878,
one hundred and one colonists; during the same year the bark Azor transported two
hundred and forty. It is but a spoonful dipped from this deep sea. It is but the
smallest possible percentage even of the increase of the colored population of
America. Meanwhile, what are we to do with the five millions who remain, and
with their children and their children’s children? What we do for them we
must do for them here.
</p>

<p>We, too, believe in colonization; in the evangelization of Africa by Africans;
and the only difference in our aim and purpose from the work with which the Doctor
is so fully identified, is that we want to distribute our colonists more widely.
It is well to have a Christian republic in Africa. But it is our desire to plant
small colonies of twenty-five or thirty, among whom shall be both ministers and
mechanics, here and there through the still “dark continent”&mdash;points of radiation
for the light of life and of Christian civilization which they are to hold forth.
</p>

<p>We are full of sympathy and interest with the good work in Liberia. May the
Lord bless it abundantly. But the work here is not hopeless. Hundreds of
thousands of the Freedmen still answer, from amid all their disappointments and
disabilities, “We are rising.” Our plan and purpose desire to take part in both
hemispheres of the whole rounded work&mdash;to save the African in America and in
Africa alike.
</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>DR. BLYDEN ON THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION.</h3>

<p class="p1">The American Missionary Association, whose publications
we have prefixed to this paper, in their work of lofty and noble
purpose through the South are endeavoring to prepare the negro for
higher spheres of labor than “cotton-fields, turpentine orchards, and
rice-fields.” Every negro who is at all acquainted with matters in the
United States must have the highest admiration for it. Almost alone
among the benevolent institutions of that land in the days of the great
struggle, they never for one moment yielded to the imperious dictates
of an oligarchical monopoly, but gave expression to the idea which they
inscribed upon their banner, that one of the chief purposes of their
organization was to resist the tyranny of the autocracy which doomed
the negro to perpetual servitude. No one could be enrolled among its
members who was a slave-holder. They have the gratitude of the negro
race.
</p>

<p>But history will have a brighter page than even that with which
to adorn their annals, when she comes to recount the devotion and
sacrifices of the hundreds who have been sent forth under their
auspices, as uplifters of the prostrate host in the South, to whom,
left as they were, paralyzed by slavery, free movement

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>

and real progress were intrinsically impossible without the aid of such
agencies as the American Missionary Association. As time rolls on, the
romance which clings to those heroes who fought to unfetter the body of
the slave, will fade beside the halo which will surround these who have
labored to liberate his mind.
</p>

<p class="right">(<cite>Methodist Quarterly Review.</cite>)</p> </div>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>REV. CHARLES B. VENNING.</h3>

<p class="p1">One of our most earnest and devoted missionaries at
the Jamaica Mission, after severe and protracted suffering, has
entered into his rest. Mr. Venning went about fifty years ago, when
Negro-slavery was at its height, to work on a Jamaica sugar estate. He
was then an ardent young Englishman, and easily led into dissipation
and vice. But the Lord arrested him, and the course of his whole life
was changed. He entered the Mico Institute, a Training College for
Schoolmasters, and was a successful teacher. He then became interested
in the efforts of the American Missionary Association, and desired to
devote himself entirely to school work and religious teaching among
the Negroes in the country districts of the Island. His name stands
on the list of missionaries in our first Annual Report, and he has
labored faithfully every year since&mdash;while his health would permit
by active efforts, and when on a bed of suffering by example and
counsel.
</p>

<p>We quote the following from the letter of a fellow missionary: “I
never saw a man who so entirely devoted himself to the work as he did.
He had the true missionary spirit. He not only preached the Gospel in
his own church, but from house to house and in the most out-of-the-way
places; indeed everywhere where men would give a listening ear. No
other missionary in the Island did so much for the education of his
people as Bro. Venning, and outside of the towns there could be found
no people so intelligent as his. He watched over his flock with almost
a painful interest&mdash;encouraged and reproved. He gathered the
poor that were otherwise uncared for about his own door, gave them
shelter, fed them from his own table, and clothed them from his own
wardrobe.”
</p>

<p>One who knew him intimately at the Island writes: “He labored
literally night and day most earnestly for the salvation of souls and
the welfare of those who had been converted. Being a born educator,
he has left his mark upon the generation that has grown up under his
instruction. As a private Christian, he was most real and honest, and
free from all guile, exemplifying in all his life, in the most striking
manner, those beautiful words of Scripture ‘harmless’ and ‘blameless.’
His faith triumphed nobly in the end. In my interviews with him of
late, it has been most interesting to see with how firm a grasp he held
fast to the assurances of God’s blessed word, and thus found perfect
rest and peace to his soul.”

<h3>ITEMS FROM THE FIELD.</h3>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Nashville,

confession and one by letter. It was a blessed day with us. There is

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>

much here to do. Miss E. W. Douglass is a great help to us. The people
all like her. She is at work any and everywhere. They call her in some

songs, recitations, etc. The Rev. P. J. McEntosh has had this school
and church at Anniston in charge for a number of years and has labored
with untiring energy to elevate the colored people, and has met with a
great deal of encouragement. After the school exercises, the presents
from the Christmas tree were distributed among the children. Several
white visitors were present and spoke very highly of the management of
the church and school. On Friday night, they gave a fair at which they

<p>The house is 18×36, containing two rooms 18×18, with two windows
and a door in each room and a chimney in the middle. Each room is
to contain three bedsteads, and from six to nine chairs. The house
completed and furnished will cost $228.68, a little more than we
calculated, but it is large, well built and well furnished.

hay, grain, corn, and corn-fodder, 300 bushels of cotton-seed, with
tools and farm-implements and three cows, were burnt Wednesday night,
Jan. 7. Evidently it was the work of an incendiary, but not instigated
at all by any prevailing ill-will toward the College. Subscriptions
were at once circulated among citizens, both white and black, and
while the amount raised is not large, the number and willingness of
the contributions prove the interest felt by this community in the
College. Efforts will be made to rebuild at once. The loss is estimated
at $1,200. It falls heavily on the agricultural department, which is
becoming an important factor in the college work. The farm does much
toward feeding the large family, and gives opportunity of self-help to
the young men.

<h3>AFRICAN NOTES.</h3>

<p class="p1">&mdash;The long delayed tidings have been received
by the London Missionary Society from Messrs. Hore and Hutley at
Lake Tanganika. The particulars of Mr. Dodgshun’s death are given.
Annoyances and delays interposed by the Arab slave-traders are
rehearsed. We give a few extracts from letters:&mdash;
</p>

<p>“During the seven months of our stay here, we have done much towards
making friends with the natives; they have closely observed us, and
admit that they can see nothing bad; but the influence of the Arabs
is so powerful that they, the Wajiji, are afraid to make any definite
negotiations with us apart from the Arabs.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“The slave-trade at Ujiji is merely a small local
affair&mdash;slaves captured in war, &amp;c., amongst surrounding
tribes, and passed from hand to hand, till they finally come to a stand
in some Arab’s <i lang="sw" xml:lang="sw">shamba</i>: this used to be
done in the market, but since we came here, it has all been kept out
of sight. Once only some Wajiji offered us a slave for sale as they
passed by our <i lang="sw" xml:lang="sw">tembe</i>. The traders owning
these domestic slaves, have from twenty to one hundred of them (I think
Muniyi Heri reaches the larger number); they are their domestics,
boatmen, carriers, body guard, and cultivators, and, of course, form
the principle population of the place, filling up with huts the spaces
between their masters’ larger houses.
</p>

<p>“Slavery amongst the natives is another matter. The Wajiji are great
slave-holders, slaves being as common as domestic servants at home;
but no great numbers are owned by individuals as among the Arabs. A
common present between chiefs is one or two slaves, and Mirambo sends
small parties from time to time to buy both slaves and ivory. When the
Portuguese and Arab slave-trades are crushed out, or nearly so, we
shall see and more fully realize the extent of native slavery, or slave
customs, which cover the continent through its length and breadth. The
former will have cost an immense outlay of the power and influence of
civilized Europe ere it is swept away. The latter will take years of
faithful mission labor to eradicate.

<p>“To fulfil my promise to an Arab, to whom I said, ‘We do not want
to buy except for our own use; but I will send your words to England,’
I add these few lines:&mdash;The Arabs say, ‘If the white men will
come here and buy, we will grow as much sugar and rice, and spice and
oil, &amp;c., as they want, and would much rather get our money in
that way, than in dangerous [and, as they admit one by one privately,
<em>illegal</em>] slave-hunting.’ I keep telling them that the
slave-trade is dying out, and they had better look to something else
before they are left in the lurch.”

<p>&mdash;“I have great trouble with my sailors who of course are
<em>not</em> sailors. On one occasion I was close off Cape Kiungwe.
About two <span class="medium">A. M.</span>, pitch dark, a heavy squall
burst on us from the northward, with sheets of rain. I could not see
one foot in front of my eyes. This lasted for two or three hours, the
boat sweeping along at a great rate without a stitch of canvas, and a
nasty foaming sea. All six men became perfectly helpless, and huddled
together inside the cabin. The good little binnacle, however, kept the
compass-lamp burning, and by it only I knew where to steer; had it gone
out, none of them could have put it to rights. I could

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>

not possibly let go the tiller; they were perfectly unable to work the
paddles had they been required, and it was only after roaring myself
hoarse at them that I could rouse them to bale the water out. When they
get home they strut about with a little cane in their hands, and boast
of their sailorizing.”

<p>&mdash;“I trust,” he writes, “no one will call this mission
disastrous, or condemn Ujiji hastily as unhealthy. It is certainly much
healthier than Zanzibar, and both Mr. Hutley and myself were never more
persistent in our determination to go on. Certainly we want more help,
but the work is <em>going on</em>. We are living down native prejudices
and suspicions, and the lies of slanderers. We will slacken no effort
to carry on this work; and I am speaking, not at home, but in the midst
of the work and its difficulties. May God induce His stewards to do
their part, and see in the vacant spaces of the ranks only cause for
new and earnest effort. I commenced this letter with but mournful news;
I desire to close it with an expression of thankfulness to God for what
health and strength and success He has given us, and with an earnest
appeal to all missionary hearts to apply their means and strength with
renewed vigor to this work, and to be assured that, however cavilers
may talk of disaster, there is no despondency here.”

<h3>AT TALLADEGA.</h3>

<p class="p1"><i>At the Faculty Meeting.</i>&mdash;Three men and four women
present. Prayer. The circle is passed around for matters of business.
Besides minor things these results are reached; Will observe the day
of prayer for colleges, with an address at morning worship, with a
prayer-meeting in the afternoon for the male students, one for the
females and one for the faculty, and with a general meeting at night;
will hold a Normal Institute on the last two days of the present term,
inviting the colored teachers in the region round about to come, and
asking Mr. A. W. Farnham, Normal Professor at the Atlanta University,
to be present and help; will have a series of familiar lectures,
alternating on Friday night with the young people’s sociable. Surely
all this looks like business.
</p>

<p><i>At the Library.</i>&mdash;The donation of books to the value of more
than four hundred dollars, from Rev. W. H. Willcox, of Malden, Mass.,
attracts the eye, and feasts it, too. The books are new, of standard
and current interest.
</p>

<p><i>At the Prayer Meeting.</i>&mdash;One of the colored young preachers
reports the fine large old Bible which, as the gift of some Eastern
friend, he had taken into his little church at the Cove on the
preceding Sabbath. The people had requested him to express their
thanks. Then President DeForest followed. There is a story connected
with that book. It came with a box of things from the Congregational
Church at

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>

Columbus, N.J., Rev. E. B. Turner’s. It came from Harriet Storrs, who
is a cousin of my mother. Every page of the book has been prayed over.
Out of the Sabbath-school of that old hill-town church, six ministers
of the Gospel have been raised up, among whom, I suppose, they count
myself, for that was my father’s home; and two wives of foreign
missionaries have come from the same source. Surely that old nest must
be kept warm for more of such productiveness.
</p>

<p><i>At Evening Prayers.</i>&mdash;It is in the dining-hall, where the
students of both sexes and the teachers meet. The repast over, the
President, as is his wont, gives a resumé of the current news, the
discovery of the intro-Mercurial star, the day’s phase of the Maine
affairs, and other such. Then the students at two of the tables recite
each a verse upon a particular topic, temptation; then the sweetness of
a religious song; then prayer; then a quiet and orderly retiring. It is
alone the religion of Jesus that can present such a scene.
</p>

<p><i>At the Farm.</i>&mdash;You enter its enclosure, passing under a
graceful arch that bears in large letters the emblazonment, “Winsted
Farm.” So everybody knows what town it was in Connecticut that did a
good deal toward the providing of that industrial department. The wheat
and the rye and the oats are covering the fields with green, even at
this mid-winter time. You can see that there is good farming in that
locality. You can see it, too, by contrast.
</p>

<p><i>Co-operative Farming.</i>&mdash;During the last season the colored
people about our church at Lawson’s, in Alabama, Rev. J. W. Strong,
pastor, rented a half-dozen acres of land, and cultivated the most of
it in cotton, for the purpose of adding to the fund for supporting
their school. They had a board of managers. They worked when called
upon. They plowed and hoed. They at last picked out the cotton and
found that they had two bales, worth $120. One bale they sent to the
colored folks’ Industrial Fair, on the grounds of Talladega College.
This church is now also engaged in building a house of worship, having
the frame erected, intending, with the aid of $100 from the A.M.A., to
go on this season with the finishing, and hoping that a revival will be
its process of dedication.

<h3>NORTH CAROLINA.<br /> <span class="xmedium">Our School.</span></h3>

<p class="center secauth">REV. ALFRED CONNET, MCLEANSVILLE.</p>

<p class="p1">Our school is put down as a common school. That is
correct. Yet we are laboring to make it more than a common school. To
this end we have graded it as follows:
</p>

<p>A. Normal; B. Normal. A. Intermediate; B. Intermediate. A. Primary;
B. Primary.
</p>

<p>Through the kindness of friends in the North the school had been
supplied with a good many books, and unfortunately, there was a great
variety of text-books. We have ordered new, standard books, and have
secured uniformity. As we had new books it was easy to require all to
begin at the bottom and work up, and to do thorough work.
</p>

<p>In a very few instances we have found pupils who can go into two
classes in the same branch. In this way they bring up from the first,
and at the same time go on with a more advanced class.
</p>

<p>The grading, the new books, and the uniformity of books, have each
and all had a stimulating effect. They see there is a ladder to climb.
They see they cannot start at the top, or the middle, but must begin at
the bottom. They study harder. The school has improved in numbers and
in regularity of attendance. The number enrolled is 84.
</p>

<p>Our pupils are from four counties, including this (Guilford) county.
Thirteen are here paying board, or boarding themselves. Of the thirteen
all are professors of religion but three: one is

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>

a minister, two are preparing for the ministry; one professed religion
since he came here a year ago, one of those preparing for the ministry
united with the church at the last communion, and one is a teacher.
Of those enrolled last year, seven are teachers, six of whom are now
teaching, and one attending school. One pupil who is a minister reports
over forty hopeful conversions in connection with his labors during the
summer vacation.
</p>

<p>A year ago we greatly felt the need of dormitories, and
accommodations for students to “batch.” For this the Association could
make no appropriation. One of the neighbors has put up a building for
this purpose, another is building, and a third has converted an old
store-room into dormitories, and four families have taken boarders.
Last year our school was confined to one room; now we have added a
recitation room.
</p>

<p>On the whole, the outlook is hopeful. By the close of the present
school year twelve to fifteen of our pupils will be able to obtain
teacher’s license from the County School-Examiner.

<h3>SOUTH CAROLINA.<br /> <span class="xmedium">Church and School
Work&mdash;The Cause of the Exodus.</span></h3>

<p class="center secauth">REV. TEMPLE CUTLER, CHARLESTON.</p>

<p class="p1">The work goes quietly on here in Charleston&mdash;in all
its departments. The school is flourishing. It never had so many pupils
as now, and was never more popular than under the direction of Mr.
Gaylord. We are not ashamed to have visitors from North, South, East,
or West, visit Avery. If any of your readers doubt the capacity of
these colored boys and girls, let them come and see for themselves.
</p>

<p>Miss Wells, our missionary, is doing good work&mdash;visiting the
homes and teaching the mothers and daughters how to make the home what
it should be.
</p>

<p>The church work goes on slowly. The feeling of unity and harmony
is increasing, and, so far as I can see, may be said to be universal
in the church. We have had stormy weather in Plymouth for some time;
it has been a sort of Cape Hatteras, around which the winds have
revelled, but now the sky is clear and the sea smooth. We have a large
growth of tares in the church that does neither us nor anybody else
any good. If we should undertake to root it out, I do not know how
much wheat might come up with it, nor how much wheat we would trample
down in getting to it. Oh, how wise we need to be in dealing with
these people; what a broad mantle of charity we have to throw over
them. Those of us who glean after the reapers in this field, where the
“patriarchal institution” once flourished, find that either the type of
piety that prevailed in the “Abrahamic household” was very defective,
or the “Abrahamic duty” was woefully neglected. Certainly, the idea
of religion that prevails among the former dependents of these modern
patriarchs, is not that of either the Old or New Testament. But why
throw stones at the old defunct institution? What did I say? Defunct?
I wish to God it was defunct, and that these freemen had a fair chance
and a free fight for their rights and liberties. But that day is a long
way off; and I fear the shimmer of the morn is not yet seen. I want to
be just as hopeful as possible. I never was a croaker. I generally see
the bright side of a thing. But sometimes, when I come in from some
tale of oppression and misery, the clouds just shut right down&mdash;it
is midnight. When I am made to know that there are 20,000 poor wretches
here in this city that are the carcass on which rich cormorants are
fattening, my soul is sick within me. Congress may investigate the
cause of the emigration of the colored people to all eternity, and come
to what conclusion they may, it won’t stop. I pray

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>

God it may not stop until enough laborers get away from the South to
give room for those who remain to grow. God knows the truth, and He
will open some way for His people to go out. I assure you His new
Israel has not yet come to the land flowing with milk and honey. What
think you of a man supporting a family of four on 25 cents a day, and
paying five dollars a month for house rent? What think you of a family
of five living on the wages of the daughter who gets six dollars a
month working out, and paying five dollars a month for house rent?
<em>Hungry mouths will stifle conscience.</em> Or, how long could the
good people of the North live on hasty-pudding without molasses or
milk, morning, noon and night, and nothing else, day after day and week
after week?
</p>

<p>Do you say, why not go back into the country and work the land?
So I said to one who had brought his family of five or six down here
to starve with the rest: “Why didn’t you stay up in the country?”
“Couldn’t lib up dar no how. Starve up dar shuah. Rent so high couldn’t
lib. Had free acres of land and a po, misable shantie, and had to work
fo days ob de week fur de rent, and but two days to tend my own crop.
Hab to buy ebreting ob de commisary. Hab to pay twenty cents a pound
fur meat (bacon), and forty cents a peck fur grits (corn meal). Starve
to deff up dar shuah.” Four days’ work every week for the rent of three
acres of land! The best land in that section is worth four dollars
per acre. Call the man’s work worth twenty-five cents a day. His rent
was one dollar a week&mdash;fifty-two dollars a year. No wonder the
landlords are not anxious to sell land to the colored people, when
they can get four times the value of the land every year in work at
twenty-five cents a day. Defunct institution! Yes, on the statute book.
“But, my man, why didn’t you buy the land at four dollars an acre?”
“Well, sah, some ob ’em did buy de land. I dunno how much dey pays;
but I knows when dey’s paid two or tree stalments dey can’t pay no mo,
and gibs em up.” Do you wonder the people listen to glowing pictures
of better opportunities somewhere else? If these people had a decent
chance at home, they would not listen to invitations away. The fact is,
they are perfectly helpless, and there is nothing for the mass of them
but to sit down and wait, wait, wait, through the long, long years till
the morning comes. I do not wonder they emigrate. I pray God they may
continue to go, until those who remain shall have their hands full to
supply the demands for labor. It may not be better for those that go,
but it will be better for those that remain. The more you thin out your
woodland, the taller and stouter will be your timber. The only hope
for this people is a scarcity of laborers. There are so many who must
have work, or die, that every vacancy has a dozen ready applicants.
Twenty-five cents a day, I am told, is all that some of these planters
will give to man or woman; and they can get enough at that price. In
such circumstances, you cannot expect people to haggle long about the
price of labor. The cry is simply, “Give me my hire.” And then, if you
remember that two hundred years of slavery in a man’s blood is not a
very good preparation for independency, you may get a pretty good idea
of the situation of the people.
</p>

<p>But my letter is too long. Tell the churches to pray for the freeman
of the South. I do not say freedmen, because there are thousands here
who were never slaves and are no better off. Ask the churches to help
us to give them the only consolation they can at present have&mdash;a
sure and intelligent hope of a better world than this on the other
side&mdash;and not expect them, out of their deep poverty, to pay for
their own schooling or preaching just yet.

<h3>GEORGIA.<br /> <span class="xmedium">Report of the Committee of
the Board of<br /> Commissioners to the Atlanta University, June,
1879.</span></h3>

<p>A large majority of the entire Board attended the examination of the
colored University at Atlanta, which receives an annual donation of
$8,000 from the State. The report of the special committee appointed
to make a suitable minute of the exercises and the condition of the
Institution was unanimously adopted. It is as follows:
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To the Board of Visitors</span>:</p>

<p>Gentlemen&mdash;The undersigned, your appointees, herewith submit
the following report upon the final examinations of the Atlanta
University, for the school year just closed.
</p>

<p>The Board attended these examinations in an almost entire body.
They were promptly and courteously met by President Ware and his
associates, and the examinations proceeded with systematic regularity.
The exercises were designated by neatly printed programmes, with the
time and place of recitation distinctly set forth.
</p>

<p>The examinations were fairly conducted and disclosed the fact that
the most advanced methods of teaching were employed. These methods were
mainly topical, supplemented by appropriate questions, which evinced
that the students had an intelligent comprehension of the subjects
under consideration. We were especially impressed by the evidences of
patient, systematic, untiring training on the part of the teachers,
so well adapted to the colored, or any race, and by the progressive
manner in which a subject was developed. All branches taught, passed
in review before us, and whether the immediate subject was reading,
grammar, history, mathematics, the classics, or other branches, the
means employed and the results attained were entirely satisfactory. The
examinations were entirely oral and the decorum and order maintained
were of a high character.
</p>

<p>The cleanliness of the recitation rooms, the preservation of school
property and the gradual improvement of the grounds were marked.</p>

<p>The final exercises at Friendship Church were very creditable to the
institution. The subjects of the speeches and essays were appropriate,
without political bearing, and they were delivered and read in a
becoming manner.
</p>

<p>Comparing the examinations with preceding ones, we are satisfied
that the University is steadily on the up-grade, and that it is
becoming a centre of great interest among the colored people.
</p>

<p>The religious training of the pupils appeared to be excellent.
</p>

<p>The Normal feature of the institution we regard with especial
interest. In no way can education be so rapidly extended, or its
improved methods so effectually multiplied, as by the special training
of teachers. This we believe to be the great educational want of our
State.
</p>

<p>We have one suggestion to make, viz: as the oral recitation has
been now so satisfactorily developed, would it not be beneficial to
introduce some written examination work in the higher classes, as
affording a better comparative test, and as advancing the examinations
fully up to the modern standard?
</p>

<p>It is your committee’s opinion, based upon the foregoing, that the
State has acted wisely in her appropriation to the Atlanta University,
and that a continuance of it is to her best interests.

<h3>ALABAMA.<br /> <span class="xmedium">Why He Likes It.</span></h3>

<p class="center secauth">REV. H. S. DEFORREST, TALLADEGA.</p>

<p class="p1">A minister recently called to one of our schools in the
South, gives these reasons for liking his place.
</p>

<p>1st. I am needed. This is a great work and the workmen are few. It
is not at all here as it used to be, and perhaps now is, in Boston
on a Saturday morning, scores of men standing with carpet-bag in
hand, waiting for a chance to preach, and many waiting in vain. We
have here more of field than we can occupy. On all sides comes up the
Macedonian-African cry, “come over and help us.” I am often weary on
Saturday and poorly enough prepared for Sunday, but am spared the
anguish of not knowing where to go or what to do. Besides, there is so
much of self-denial in the work that there are probably not a great
many thinking that, if I should die or leave, there would be a vacancy,
and if there should be a vacancy they would like to fill it. Not many
are interested in my will; few would care for my shoes,&mdash;I hope to
wear them myself and wear them here. For,
</p>

<p>2nd. There is here a grand, perhaps unsurpassed opportunity for
influencing men. I am not only a Home Missionary, but also a Foreign
Missionary to Africa, and that last with special facilities. I am
master of the language, and do not work at the disadvantage of a
half-learned and half-murdered tongue. Neither is there any prejudice
against me as a Foreigner because of my brogue, or my dress or my
habits. Without the honors of a Foreign Missionary, I am also without
many of his disadvantages, and my national and Yankee peculiarities,
which might hinder across the sea, help on this side of the Atlantic.
This is indeed a missionary field, but operated with special
facilities. It is a double missionary field. For,
</p>

<p>3d. The most pressing work in our own country is here. As surely as
in 1861 our national peril is largely in the South. Ignorance is dense;
immorality is rampant: lawlessness is wide-spread, while intelligence,
morality and obedience to law form the only basis for such a government
as ours. To save our country, we must save the South; to save the
South, we must save the Southerners, and there are no Southerners
more hopeful and more deserving than the late slaves. They are down
but their faces are upward. Give them a hand and they will take it,
especially if it be a “Yankee hand,” and a little lifting develops a
good deal of spring in themselves. Thus it is that Patriotism as well
as Humanity and Christianity keep me here, and no campaigning in our
recent war seemed more a duty of loyalty than that in which I am now
engaged. I am glad to be in the ranks and to still wear the blue.
But,
</p>

<p>4th. Looking beyond our broad land, I hope, standing here, to reach
some portion of the “Dark Continent.” I regard this as a good <em>pou
sto</em> for moving Africa. Our students, more than those who have
been life-long readers, use their memories. They are more impressible
than the young of some other stock. They have a strong desire, as they
are helped, to help others. Apparently the great missionary movement
of the next few years is to be in Africa. The call is already heard
for men. Some of these men are here, and the impressions now made, the
very words we now speak, may yet be felt and heard in lands whence the
fathers of these men were stolen, and in the jungles which the white
man may well fear to tread.
</p>

<p>5th. Besides, there are some special rewards in this work. If we
have the white man’s contumely, we have the black man’s love. A more
grateful and appreciative people than some of these, fresh from the
prison-house of bondage but now rejoicing in a double freedom, I have
never seen. Seldom is a pastor more fervently and affectionately prayed

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>

for than are some of us here. And I suspect as the Lord judges
souls&mdash;He seeth not as man seeth&mdash;we have our companionship
chiefly with the foremost of this part of the Land. These and similar
considerations have led me to think that this College stands somewhere
on Mt. Pisgah. Certainly just now I would rather be here than in any
other part of the Universe of God. Tell our friends at the North that
we do not need their sympathy but we do need their help. With more of
means we could greatly multiply our labors and their results. Let those
at the rear at least send on supplies, and more abundantly.
</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>Is the Work in Vain?&mdash;Building Progress&mdash;A Missionary
Spirit.</h3>

<p class="center secauth">REV. HORACE J. TAYLOR, ATHENS.</p>

<p class="p1">Sometimes one is tempted to say that the work here is in
vain. We know, for instance, that a great deal has been done during
the last fifteen years by the Principal of Trinity School, and yet one
can see that the work is by no means finished. Have not some people at
the North been thinking that, after fifteen years of good work among
the colored people of the South, the A.M.A. ought to be about leaving
the field here for some other? Some here say to me, it will be a work
of centuries to bring up this people; others, that the colored race
never will be fit for anything but farm laborers; they must be hewers
of wood and drawers of water. Some people in Ohio think the religion
of the colored man in the South is a “pure and undefiled” religion.
Some people here think there is no use in trying to give the colored
man a pure system of religion. “They get together and shout and carry
on, and that is all they are fitted for.” “Their religion is impure
and defiled, and they cannot appreciate a pure religion.” So say the
enemies of the colored race. Well, this is partly true; too true. The
colored man has emotion, and his late masters were too often content
with that “religion” in the slave. As slaves they were allowed to
preach and steal and commit adultery, and all together, too.
</p>

<p>When we think of the pit from which they have been lifted, and of
their ancestry&mdash;only a few generations ago heathen all of them,
cannibals some of them&mdash;can we think that the results are less
than we might expect? A great deal has been done here, and there is a
great deal to show for it. Some might think there was not much to be
seen of good results. A church of forty-four members&mdash;three less
than two years ago, five less than one year ago&mdash;some weak ones,
the church as well as the school still pecuniarily dependent on the
A.M.A., they will not be ready to cut loose from the fostering care of
the Association for some years yet.
</p>

<p>Christ said that the kingdom of heaven was like a grain of mustard
seed, or like a little leaven. These churches and schools act like
leaven in a mass of ignorance. And this leaven works. And it is because
of this leavening power of the Gospel that we are encouraged. The whole
will be leavened in time. But time is necessary. The Congregational
churches have undertaken a mighty work, and they must patiently stick
to it for years yet. Much as can be seen of the results of the work
here, more than half of it cannot be easily seen. Other churches have
been enlightened and helped. Even those who try to keep out the light
can’t prevent some of it getting through the chinks.

<p>You will want to know about the work for the new school building. If
we had had the least idea that we must work five months with less than
one hundred dollars in money, we never would have undertaken the job.
We hoped a fair share of the subscriptions would be paid in cash. One
or two had themselves to buy the moulds for making the bricks, and the
shovels to dig with,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>

and the cord to line the ground with. We had no boards to cover the
bricks, so, instead of kilning the bricks as they were made, they were
piled in an old log house. Many were broken in this way. Then they were
moved when we had boards to cover the kiln; and many more were broken.
And from the 1st of August&mdash;we didn’t begin to prepare the ground
till July 17th&mdash;till November we had heavy and frequent rains.
The papers said such a season had not been known for many years. We
were hindered in our work, and lost bricks from the rains. But we have
over a hundred thousand bricks, and a total expense of one hundred
and fifty dollars. If the workers next summer can have the money, as
we hope, they will not work to such disadvantage, for they will have
boards on hand, and can kiln the bricks as they make them, and have
tools. The building will be finished, but it takes more time than we at
first thought. Such a school-house was not necessary fifteen years ago.
Our neat church building, and the necessity for a substantial school
building, are proofs of the great work done here by Miss Wells. I enjoy
this work, and have become attached to the people. But it is too nice
a place for me. I never expected to preach from a carpeted platform. I
must go far hence to more destitute places beyond&mdash;to the islands
of the sea. But the work is one. Whether in Alabama or Micronesia,
under the A.M.A. or the A.B.C.F.M., we are working for one Lord, to
establish the kingdom of Christ on earth. We can but praise Him that He
calls us to work in any corner of His wide vineyard.

<h3>MISSISSIPPI.<br /> <span

Rooms.</span></h3>

<p class="center secauth">MRS. G. STANLEY POPE, TOUGALOO.</p>

<p class="p1">The year thus far has been most pleasant and profitable.
During the fall term we had an unusually large number of students who
entered into study with faithfulness and energy.
</p>

<p>Many who had been teaching during the summer, gave most interesting
reports of their work. The Sunday-school and temperance work had been
vigorously pushed with excellent results; one of which is over thirteen
hundred signers to the temperance pledge. Some conversions in their
Sunday-schools were also reported; and quite often now some one speaks
in our prayer-meeting of receiving a letter from a pupil asking for
prayers that he may become a Christian.
</p>

<p>Just at the close of the fall term we were visited with a remarkable
outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Our good Dr. Roy had been here, and a
sermon which he preached left impressions which brought some to decide
for Christ. And then the Sunday-school lessons. I remember watching the
young people during the closing exercises of Sunday-school the Sabbath
before Christmas, and I saw that there was deep feeling, and felt sure
that there were some who would not long resist the Spirit, and during
the next three days there were nineteen conversions.
</p>

<p>Three or four others have since then found Christ. There is also
a marked Christian growth and a growing interest in the study of the
Bible. Our hearts are greatly encouraged, and we go forward rejoicing
that we are permitted to work for Christ. Truly “The Lord hath done
great things for us whereof we are glad.”
</p>

<p>At present we have one hundred and four boarders, with the prospect
of more soon. Every room is occupied, and we are crowded to what seems
the utmost limit of our accommodations. What we shall do with those
yet to come, is a problem which neither mathematics nor the laws of
expansion have solved. Shall they hang up in the trees or bivouac under
them? We want to put an addition to the “barracks,” but have not the
means necessary. Dear friends at the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>

North, shall we turn these young people away? What is your answer?
We hope that by a year from now, a good substantial building will be
at least in process of erection, that shall do away with some of the
temporary accommodations we now have.

<h3>TENNESSEE.<br /> <span class="xmedium">School Work and Week of
Prayer.</span></h3>

<p class="center secauth">E. A. H., MEMPHIS.</p>

<p class="p1">Next week will, I believe, close my second month’s work
here. I find the work very pleasant, and am enjoying it greatly, though
I think I am working harder than I have ever worked in a school before.
The school has filled up very rapidly since the holidays. My room is
full to overflowing, and I have been obliged to seat a few of my pupils
in the Normal room. That room and the Primary are also quite full.
Of course, these additions to the school have made the work of the
teachers much harder. Besides my work with my own pupils, I am having
some practice work done. Four students from the Senior Class of the
Normal Department, are engaged for a short time each day in teaching
in my department, and under my supervision. This corps of teachers
is changed once in two weeks, thus giving each pupil in that class a
chance to work. I also meet the Senior Class three times a week, for
talks with them on school and class work, taking up the objects to be
gained by recitations and the best methods used. I think I can see
already that this work is doing good, and I hope that it may prove of
great value to the pupils.
</p>

<p>We have been observing the week of prayer in the school, by fifteen
minute prayer meetings, directly after school. At first, these were
held in a recitation room, but Thursday evening the meeting had grown
so large that it was held in the Intermediate room, and Friday evening
in the Assembly room. A good deal of interest has been shown, and a
number have expressed a desire for the prayers of Christians. We hope
that the interest may deepen and much good be done.

<h3>TEXAS.<br /> <span class="xmedium">Two Hours’ Work by a
Student-Canvasser.</span></h3>

<p class="p1">The following letter, with enclosure of $3.50 and
fourteen names for the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span> for six
months, will not only explain itself, but may furnish a suggestive
example to many.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friends</span>: Of course you will
be curious to know how it happened that some persons in this
place&mdash;Marshall, Texas&mdash;suddenly conclude to read the
<span class="smcap">American Missionary</span>, consequently I send
you these words of explanation. I am indebted to your schools for
all the education I possess. I attended Straight University five
months&mdash;from January to June, 1874; then beautiful Fisk University
nearly nine months&mdash;from September to May, 1879, entering college
regularly with the class. Commencement over, I set out for Texas,
earnestly desiring to secure means to go through with; but, owing
to bad health and the want of proper precaution, I failed. I was
unwilling to return immediately to Fisk University empty-handed, to
give my teachers additional concern about my welfare, and, as I am
firmly resolved to complete the course, everything to the contrary
notwithstanding, something had to be done. Hence I decided to remain
in Texas a few months longer, giving my wife, who is at Nashville, the
choice of remaining there or joining me here, until the difficulty is
past. I could get no paying work right away, having walked upwards of
two hundred miles and spent three weeks of valuable time in the search.
Finally, weary, foot-worn and exhausted, I fell under the effects of
intermittent fever&mdash;indeed, I was in trouble. Nothing remained,
then, but to be idle two months or more, at the expiration of which I
could begin to teach, in accordance with a contract that I then held.
In the meantime my

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>

class would be making progress; this thought, believe me, gave me as
much concern as my ill-health. I carried the subject to the Lord in
prayer and became reconciled. I reached Marshall, on the 22d instant. I
plainly stated my case to the teachers of this Institution. They seemed
to sympathize with me, and on the following morning assigned me work.
Thus, you see, I am doing something, though it may be very little.
</p>

<p>I heard an interesting discourse Sabbath evening from I. Corinthians
xv., 58. The preacher proved clearly to my mind that Christians ought
to be zealous of good works for the churches to which they belong.
He proved, too, that all could do something. The whole furnished me
excellent food for reflection. I began to figure out how much we
colored people in the South could advance your glorious work if we only
had the zeal. I found, indeed, that we are neglecting a very important
service; so I resolved, not having anything else in view, to secure
some subscribers to the <span class="smcap">American Missionary</span>,
and within two hours yesterday I begged fourteen persons to put down
their names. Now, suppose each one of your students in the South should
do even that much, is it not plain that you would soon have a large
constituency here as well as in New England? Such service alone would
increase your subscription-list by many thousands, and add largely to
your income, as well as disseminate, as should be, a wide knowledge
of your work. Let, then, every one, put his hand to the wheel, for
all can do something. Believe me, I am heartily ashamed of myself,
now that I can see what an excellent opportunity of doing great good
I have lost by not doing the lesser. I have lived, more or less, in
no fewer than twenty towns, and I have taught in at least fifteen
different schools since I first left one of your schools, at any one
of which I ought to have raised at least as many subscribers to the
<span class="smcap">American Missionary</span> as I have here. I have
been a Christian for several years, but unfortunately one of that class
who are afraid to “stand up for Jesus.” I am feeling differently now,
consequently am likely to fly to the other extreme. Should any little
work, then, suggest itself to you, such as you may regard me capable
of performing, why be assured that a willing servant is at hand. It is
to be very much regretted that, since I have to remain here, I could
not be with the teachers at Tillotson College; still those who can work
will work anywhere.

<h3>AN INDIAN BOY’S LETTER.</h3>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>: I was born in
Grand Island, Neb. in the 15 day of November. My mother was married
by a white man, and used to live in Grand Island, and my father was
scouting with the Pawnees, and once it rain very hard and he got
lightling struck and died; I did not know him, I never seen him, my
mother tells me about him. When he died, my mother went back to her
home, and lived with her brother, who lived like a white man. In 1869 I
went on a hunting bufflos with the Pawnees and Puncas. We went on about
three days; they found some bufflos, so all the men got their best
horses and fixed them up, and then took their bows and arrows and guns.
They went all around them, and then they just run their horses to see
who’ill get there first, one man would

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>

kill two or three, sometimes four and eight, and they skin them, and
take them home, skin and all. The skins is used for mocassins and men
legends (leggings). Once I went swimming while the men went after
bufflos, while I was in the water I seen a bufllo coming where I was,
frightened me to, I had to climbed upon a tree. It was mad, and some
men were after him; and had some arrows in him. They killed it, and
then I got down, and I seen them skin it. We had lots bufflo meat; we
camp the same place, the Indians were drying their meat, so it will
less (last) long. After while we went on again, we went on till sun
was sat. Next morning they seen some more bufflos; they killed many
more; they had to stay there till their meat was dry. We stayed there
and then the Indian women got their work things and work on with their
skins. They finished them and had lots meat and skins. We return home
again.
</p>

<p>I just eat dry meat all the time. No town near to buy some bread
nor sugar. I used to be hungry for bread. I used to cry for bread. My
stepfather had to take me where their was some Pawnees, that did not go
on hunting. We got there. I had all the bread I want. I was glad then.
The next day we went on and got to a town; and got in the cars, and
went on; we got to another town; we get out and went to my home, and
then they sent me to school. I went to school four months. I went home
again.
</p>

<p>After while some of the Pawnees ran away from their homes, went to
Indian Territory and stayed there for couple years, had nice time and
had many ponies, then one went back home and told them it was very
nice down the Territory, and it made part of the Chiefs think it would
be nice to go down there. They used to have a counsil all day, and
had a counsil one year. One Chief did not want to go down there; that
was Lone Chief, because he liked that place, because the Pawnees were
civilized when they were up there. They commencing putting up their
houses, and farming. They went down there. I went down with them. When
I was there, I used to work on my farm. I have got a farm my own. I use
to go to school in winter. I had been wanting to go to school somewhere
else. I am very glad they took me to Hampton School. I think my friends
will help me all they can. I want to learn all I can at Hampton School
and stay here till four or five years, my mother was willing for me to
go to school and be among the white people, and when I went to Indian
Territory, and I went to the day school one year, and the next year I
went to the Boarding School. I never use to talk English one year ago,
but the Agent at my home, keep me at his office where there was many
white men were writing. They use to talk to me all the time in English,
and then I learn how, and then I use to interpret for the Agent.</p>

<p>When we first went down to the Territory, there use to be many
sickness; they used to die; they were not use to in warm country. Once
I was sick. I had the chills and favor. I near died. I got well again;
before I came away, I plow part of my field and sowed some wheat, but I
have got brothers who will work at my field while I am away, and keep
my horses good, and houses. Some white people used to want to take me.
When I was at home I used to write to Col. Meachem, to help me to go to
some school. He did help me, and I am glad I went to Hampton School.
I am trying to be a good boy, and study all I can. The only thing
troubles me is Geography, that is the only thing I have to try hard.</p>

<p class="p1">We have sustained a mission school among the Chinese at
Sacramento for nearly ten years; but our first public anniversary was

<p>“The attendance was good, and the exercises thrilling with
Christian interest to one who can see in such facts the beginning
of a great tidal wave of grace that is yet to flow over the Chinese
empire; and, what is more, a good collection was taken, showing the
interest to be genuine. The exercises consisted of recitations of
classified Scripture, an original address, an original dialogue, and
singing&mdash;all by the Chinese&mdash;and brief introductory and
closing exercises by others. The mission is in a very prosperous
condition, and shows the fruits of the earnest, faithful teaching of
those who have had charge of the school, and especially of the present
principal, Mrs. Carrington.”

<h4>ADDRESS BY LEM CHUNG.</h4>

<p class="p1">“Ladies and gentlemen: I am very glad to see you all
here this evening. I thank you very much for your kindness, teaching
us about the Gospel of Jesus Christ, because our people are in very
darkness indeed, worshiping idols. I would like to tell you of
something I did when I was a little boy at home. My parents were
very careful to attend to worshiping idols, but on the first day of
the year they must worship more than any other day of the year. At
this time I used to carry a basket with some sacrifice in it, follow
after my father from place to place where the different gods were for
worshiping. I believe on them very much. I thought the idols can help
us a great deal. So when I was at school one day, I wrote a piece of
paper, it represent a sage, and I put it inside of my desk. I then
bought some nuts and wine and offered to him, and bowed my head to him,
and ask him to help me about my lessons, that I might recite them well,
and I said, ‘If you do not help me to recite my lessons well, when I
return I tear you off and burn you up.’ When the time come I could not
recite very well, so then <em>I burn it</em>. I had been at school
about three years. My father sent me to the high school professor.
Explaining the book of Confucius at that time, I often go with the
priest to help them play the music for worshiping the evil spirits.
After little while the priest came to my father, see if he can let me
go learn to be a priest. My father was willing to let me go, but when
my

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>

mother knew it she said, ‘I cannot spare my son to be a priest,
worshiping too much for the evil spirit, but I rather to send him to
California, getting his living.’
</p>

<p>“Nearly five years have passed since I leaved my native land
and came to this country, where I found all the things strange and
different from what I had ever seen before. I found there was much for
me to learn. A friend of mine invited me to Sunday-school, and I went
with him. When I returned to the Chinatown I ask some person what kind
of people are they who teach us there? They said, American people; but
I could not know how it was that they should be willing to come and
teach us without pay. They told me that they were very good people who
come to teach you, and talk about Jesus Christ, and show us the right
way. I kept on going till I can read the Bible. Great many things very
different from other books. My heart was touch of Christ. I could not
understand all; but not many days after the same friend invited me to
go with him to the evening mission school. So I went with him to the
school. After the lessons were over, the Chinese helper explained the
Bible and talk to us, telling us it was useless to serve idols; they
cannot help us; <em>they cannot take care of themselves</em>. But we
must come to God of heaven, who made all things, heaven and earth. We
must ask Him to help us, and pray to Him to give us all things what we
need. We ought to praise Him. So when I heard him say this I saw and
felt all I had done before was of no use, and was very wicked. Then I
make up my mind to leave off worshiping idols, and begin to worship
the true and living God. So I went back where I was employed. When I
kneeled down to pray I opened my window, because I thought God cannot
hear me if I leave it closed. After a few days the Chinese helper
request me to join the Association of Christian Chinese, which I did,
and read the Bible day by day, learning more about Christ. Oh, friends,
I was very happy when I was converted! when I come to Jesus and worship
the true God; leave the darkness and follow the light, and try to lead
others of my countrymen to learn of Jesus, and know Him who died for us
and save us from sin.
</p>

<p>“When my father heard I follow Christ he sent me a letter. He said:
‘What are you doing out there? Are you going to believe Jesus, and
leave all your countrymen, and your ancestors, and idols, and Confucius
unserved?’ And he said: ‘No other way better than Confucius; so many
of your countrymen do not believe Christ. You must leave off and come
back to <em>our own way</em>. Believe the way that most of our people
believe.’ But Christ tell us, ‘He that loveth father or mother more
than Me not worthy of Me.’ I cannot leave off the way of Christ for the
way of darkness; but I can try to bring them to Jesus. I hope you all,
brethren, who come to Christ, will help hold up the light of the Gospel
to shine on them which are in the dark and bow down to idols, and that
many of my countrymen shall go back to China to tell the glad news to
thousands there who have never heard of Christ; and if we cannot reward
you, God will reward you every one.”
</p>

<p>I have not been willing to correct any of the little mistakes
of grammar, but give the address in exact copy from the original.
It was uttered in a clear voice, with a distinct and quite correct
pronunciation, and with such simple earnestness that every eye was
fixed upon him, and every heart seemed touched. Lem Chung has been
our helper in Sacramento for about eight months, is <em>growing</em>
mentally and spiritually, and gives promise of a very useful
future.

<h3>HOW TO MAKE MONEY FOR THE MISSIONARIES.<br /> <span
class="xmedium">An original Essay written by a Girl eleven years
old,<br /> and read by her at a Woman’s Foreign Missionary Meeting in
Indiana.</span></h3>

<p class="p1">I should think that everyone could think of ways for
themselves, but I suppose we can help each other. Some ways that I may
suggest might not be thought of by others, while others in turn might
think of many ways that I would not.
</p>

<p>The first way that enters my mind is what I found to be a very good
plan at one time; have your grandfather get sick so that your father
will have to go and see him, and on his return your grandmother will
send you a present of one dollar. With it buy a pig in partnership with
someone else who has the same amount, and after feeding it with your
father’s corn for a year, sell it for twenty dollars, you of course
getting one half of it.
</p>

<p>Another way is to have a little garden and sell vegetables out of
it; and another way is to have a hen and sell eggs, or raise chickens
and sell them. One way that I found to be a good one, is to make tidies
and sell them. And those of us who are fortunate enough to have a baby
brother or sister, attend it two or three hours for a penny an hour.
And I think another good way is to be a great talker, and have your
mother give you five cents to be still. We may also relieve our mothers
very much by watering the house plants, and may be she will give us a
little bit.
</p>

<p>And I have often thought it would be a good plan to have pay for
washing dishes, and may be some of your mothers would; just mention
it to them; but mine won’t, for I have tried it! And when your mother
sends you to pick berries, just mention the missionaries to her. And if
you live in the country, gather apples, churn, kill potato bugs and dig
potatoes. And then have a penny a dozen for finding pins; and the best
place in the world to find pins is in the oldest sister’s room.
</p>

<p>And another way of getting money for our school in Persia is to
save a part of the money we spend in candies. But I hope that in our
dividing between ourselves and missions, none of us may be like the
little boy that I heard of not long ago. His uncle gave him two bright
new nickels. They were a little fortune to him, and as he looked upon
them, he said, “One of these must go for the heathen and the other for
candy.” After this decision he put them away, and every few minutes he
would go to see if his fortune was safe. But once, after having them
out, one of them was missing. What should he do? and which piece was
lost, the missionary or the candy money? His little eyes rested upon
the shining piece in his hand, and after many minutes of hard struggle
with selfishness and benevolence, he said to his mother, “It was the
missionary money that I lost!” But then I guess that bigger folks than
children often have their business plans, which they think cannot be
broken into by missionaries.

<p><span class="smcap">Art. I.</span> This Society shall be called
“<span class="smcap">The American Missionary Association</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. II.</span> The object of this Association
shall be to conduct Christian missionary and educational operations,
and diffuse a knowledge of the Holy Scriptures in our own and other
countries which are destitute of them, or which present open and urgent
fields of effort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. III.</span> Any person of evangelical
sentiments,<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A"></a><a
href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> who professes faith in
the Lord Jesus Christ, who is not a slave-holder, or in the practice
of other immoralities, and who contributes to the funds, may become a
member of the Society; and by the payment of thirty dollars, a life
member; provided that children and others who have not professed
their faith may be constituted life members without the privilege of
voting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IV.</span> This Society shall meet
annually, in the month of September, October or November, for the
election of officers and the transaction of other business, at such
time and place as shall be designated by the Executive Committee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. V.</span> The annual meeting shall be
constituted of the regular officers and members of the Society at the
time of such meeting, and of delegates from churches, local missionary
societies, and other co-operating bodies, each body being entitled to
one representative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VI.</span> The officers of the Society
shall be a President, Vice-Presidents, a Recording Secretary,
Corresponding Secretaries, Treasurer, two Auditors, and an Executive
Committee of not less than twelve, of which the Corresponding
Secretaries shall be advisory, and the Treasurer ex-officio,
members.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VII.</span> To the Executive Committee
shall belong the collecting and disbursing of funds; the appointing,
counselling, sustaining and dismissing (for just and sufficient
reasons) missionaries and agents; the selection of missionary fields;
and, in general, the transaction of all such business as usually
appertains to the executive committees of missionary and other
benevolent societies; the Committee to exercise no ecclesiastical
jurisdiction over the missionaries; and its doings to be subject always
to the revision of the annual meeting, which shall, by a reference
mutually chosen, always entertain the complaints of any aggrieved agent
or missionary; and the decision of such reference shall be final.</p>

<p>The Executive Committee shall have authority to fill all vacancies
occurring among the officers between the regular annual meetings;
to apply, if they see fit, to any State Legislature for acts of
incorporation; to fix the compensation, where any is given, of all
officers, agents, missionaries, or others in the employment of the
Society; to make provision, if any, for disabled missionaries, and
for the widows and children of such as are deceased; and to call, in
all parts of the country, at their discretion, special and general
conventions of the friends of missions, with a view to the diffusion of
the missionary spirit, and the general and vigorous promotion of the
missionary work.</p>

<p>Five members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for
transacting business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VIII.</span> This society, in collecting
funds, in appointing officers, agents and missionaries, and in
selecting fields of labor, and conducting the missionary work, will
endeavor particularly to discountenance slavery, by refusing to receive
the known fruits of unrequited labor, or to welcome to its employment
those who hold their fellow-beings as slaves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IX.</span> Missionary bodies, churches or
individuals agreeing to the principles of this Society, and wishing to
appoint and sustain missionaries of their own, shall be entitled to do
so through the agency of the Executive Committee, on terms mutually
agreed upon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. X.</span> No amendment shall be made to
this Constitution without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members
present at a regular annual meeting; nor unless the proposed amendment
has been submitted to a previous meeting, or to the Executive Committee
in season to be published by them (as it shall be their duty to do, if
so submitted) in the regular official notifications of the meeting.</p>

Incarnation and Atoning Sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the only Saviour
of the world; the necessity of regeneration by the Holy Spirit,
repentance, faith and holy obedience in order to salvation; the
immortality of the soul; and the retributions of the judgment in the
eternal punishment of the wicked, and salvation of the righteous.</p>

<h4>AIM AND WORK.</h4>

<p class="p1">To preach the Gospel to the poor. It originated in
a sympathy with the almost friendless slaves. Since Emancipation
it has devoted its main efforts to preparing the <span
class="smcap">Freedmen</span> for their duties as citizens and
Christians in America and as missionaries in Africa. As closely
related to this, it seeks to benefit the caste-persecuted <span
class="smcap">Chinese</span> in America, and to co-operate with
the Government in its humane and Christian policy towards the
<span class="smcap">Indians</span>. It has also a mission in <span

the Missionaries of the Association; to Life Members; to all clergymen
who take up collections for the Association; to Superintendents of
Sabbath Schools; to College Libraries; to Theological Seminaries; to

<p>Those who wish to remember the <span class="smcap">American
Missionary Association</span> in their last Will and Testament, are
earnestly requested to use the following
</p>

<hr class="quarter" />

<h4 class="nobreak">FORM OF A BEQUEST.</h4>

<p class="p1">“<span class="smcap">I bequeath</span> to my executor
(or executors) the sum of &mdash;&mdash; dollars in trust, to pay the
same in &mdash;&mdash; days after my decease to the person who, when
the same is payable, shall act as Treasurer of the ‘American Missionary
Association’ of New York City, to be applied, under the direction of
the Executive Committee of the Association, to its charitable uses and
purposes.”
</p>

<p>The will should be attested by three witnesses [in some States three
are required&mdash;in other States only two], who should write against
their names, their places of residence [if in cities, their street and
number]. The following form of attestation will answer for every State
in the Union: “Signed, sealed, published and declared by the said [A.
B.] as his last Will and Testament, in presence of us, who, at the
request of the said A. B., and in his presence, and in the presence of
each other, have hereunto subscribed our names as witnesses.” In some
States it is required that the Will should be made at least two months
before the death of the testator.

<p>A little effort on the part of our friends, when making their own remittances, to

widen the influence of our Magazine, and aid in the enlargement of our work.</p>

<p>Under the editorial supervision of Rev. <span class="smcap">Geo. M. Boynton</span>, aided by the steady
contributions of our intelligent missionaries and teachers in all parts of the field, and
with occasional communications from careful observers and thinkers elsewhere, the
<span class="smcap">American Missionary</span> furnishes a vivid and reliable picture of the work going forward
among the Indians, the Chinamen on the Pacific Coast, and the Freedmen as
citizens in the South and as missionaries in Africa.</p>

<p>It will be the vehicle of important views on all matters affecting the races among
which it labors, and will give a monthly summary of current events relating to their
welfare and progress.</p>

<p>Patriots and Christians interested in the education and Christianizing of these
despised races are asked to read it, and assist in its circulation. Begin with the next
number and the new year. The price is only Fifty Cents per annum.</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
